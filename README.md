## A little theory
Microlensing - the lensing effects of small-sized lenses in the universe. Such effects are mostly detectable within our galaxy, so we will focus on microlenses in the Milky Way.

Prameters: - **$D_L$** - angular diameter distance to the lens
           - **$D_S$** - angular diameter distance to the source
           - **$D_{LS}$** - angular diameter distance between the lens and the source

The Einstein radius: $\theta_E \equiv \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{c^2}\frac{D_{LS}}{D_LD_S}}$
